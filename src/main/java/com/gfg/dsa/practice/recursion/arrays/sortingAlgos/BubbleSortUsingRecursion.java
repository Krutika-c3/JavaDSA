/*
    Time complexity:
        Best: O(n) when array is already sorted
        Worst: O(n^2) when array is sorting in descending order
    Space complexity:
        O(1)
        No extra space required (like copying the arrayâ€¦ AKA inplace sorting algorithm)
    Stability:
        Stability in sorting algorithms means that the relative order of equal elements remains unchanged after sorting.
        Yes, Bubble Sort is considered a stable sorting algorithm.
    Steps:
    1. Keep comparing element to all other elements
    2. If you find current element is greater than an element, swap those
    3. Repeat 1 and 2 until largest element is at the last index in unsorted array
    4. Move to next iteration
    5. Repeat 1,2,3 and 4 for all elements
